# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## ðŸ“ŒProject Overview
This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict **customer churn** for a bank.  
Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company.  
By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers.

The ANN is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, with data preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Name:** Churn_Modelling.csv
- **Target:** `Exited` column (1 = Customer left, 0 = Customer stayed)  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** â€“ Loaded dataset, checked structure, and analyzed target distribution.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“  
   - Removed unnecessary columns (`RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`,`Geography`,`Gender`)    
   - Scaled features for better ANN performance  
3. **Train-Test Split** â€“ Split dataset into training and testing sets.  
4. **Model Building (ANN)** â€“  
   - Input layer: Number of neurons = number of features  
   - Hidden layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation  
   - Output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification  
5. **Model Compilation & Training** â€“ Optimizer: Adam, Loss: Binary Crossentropy, Metrics: Accuracy  
6. **Model Evaluation** â€“  
   - Accuracy score    
7. **Prediction on New Data** â€“ Tested ANN with new hypothetical customer data.
